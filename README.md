**Replicated Liu, Stambaugh & Yuan (2019) for SSE A-Shares** — Collected and cleaned stock returns and market cap data (2000–2023) to **reconstruct the CH-3 factor model** exactly per the paper’s methodology, including small-cap exclusion and EP-based value factor. Evaluated SIZE and VALUE factors’ performance, reproduced key CAPM and CH-3 regression results for market cap and EP anomalies, and compared against CSMAR factors. Extended the analysis to a post-2017 sample to assess consistency, interpreting changes in the context of China’s IPO policy shifts.
